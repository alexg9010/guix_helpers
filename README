# init-guix

Manage per project dependencies using guix profiles.

## Description

This script is an attempt to implement the multiple guix profiles philosophy described at https://guix.gnu.org/cookbook/en/guix-cookbook.html#Guix-Profiles-in-Practice .

## Details

The script `init_guix.sh` is used to automate the management of guix profiles from a `manifest.scm`, by
checking for changes and updating the profile if required.

If it finds a manfest.scm file in the current folder it initialises a guix profile in a folder $HOME/.guix-extra-profile and caches the md5sum of the manifest file.
On the next call, it checks the current state and updates the profile and cache if required.
